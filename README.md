# Autonomous Robot - Code Repository

Welcome to the **Autonomous Robot Project** repository!
This repo contains all source code related to our school project: building and programming a robot capable of autonomous navigation and decision-making.

## Table of Contens

## Project Overview
The software is written to be **modular**, allowing eacht team member to work on a separate subsystem such as motot control, sensor integration, or naviagtion logic.

Core objectives:
- Autonomous movement and obstacle avoidance
- Real-time response to environmental data
- Modular and maintainable codebase

## Setup Instructions
**Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/autonomous-robot.git
```

## Contribution Guidelines
When making changes to the code:
    1. Always include the **code header block**at the top of each modified file.
    2. Increment the **version number** if significant changes were made.
    2. Use clear and descriptive commit messages:
    - feat: improved obstacle avoidance algorithm
    - fix: corrected motor speed calibration
    - refactor: reorganized sensor module

## Code Header Template
Every source file must begin with this header block:
```cpp
